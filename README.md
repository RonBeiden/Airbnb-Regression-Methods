# Logistic Regression Model for Predicting Listing Expense

This project focuses on building a logistic regression model using the Airbnb dataset to predict whether a given listing is expensive (1) or not (0). The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and utilizing several techniques from the sklearn library, such as KNNImputer, OneHotEncoder, and MinMaxScaler. Additionally, preliminary data analysis and research were conducted before applying these techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Airbnb dataset, which contains information about listings and their corresponding attributes. The dataset may include features such as location, property type, price, availability, and more. The target variable for this project is the "expense" feature, which is binary, with 1 indicating an expensive listing and 0 indicating an affordable listing. It is important to note that the dataset used here is assumed to be in a structured format, with rows representing individual listings and columns representing different attributes.

## Project Workflow
The following steps were followed to develop the logistic regression model for predicting listing expense:

1. Data Exploration: Before starting the preprocessing and feature engineering steps, it is essential to understand the data and gain insights into its structure. This includes examining the distribution of variables, identifying missing values, and understanding the relationships between different features.

2. Data Preprocessing: Data preprocessing is crucial for preparing the dataset before applying machine learning algorithms. This step involves handling missing values, removing irrelevant columns, handling categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features. In this project, the KNNImputer technique from the sklearn library was used to fill in missing values, ensuring the dataset is complete and ready for analysis.

3. Feature Engineering: Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the performance of the machine learning model. Techniques such as OneHotEncoder were employed to handle categorical variables by converting them into numerical representations. The MinMaxScaler was used to normalize numerical features to a consistent scale, which can enhance the learning process.

4. Logistic Regression Model: Once the dataset has been preprocessed and the features engineered, a logistic regression model was built using the processed data. Logistic regression is a popular algorithm for binary classification tasks, making it suitable for predicting whether an Airbnb listing is expensive or not.

5. Model Evaluation: After training the logistic regression model, it is important to evaluate its performance to assess its accuracy and generalization capabilities. Common evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be used to measure the model's performance.

6. Iterative Improvement: If the model's performance is not satisfactory, iterative improvement steps can be taken. This may include trying different feature engineering techniques, exploring different algorithms, or adjusting hyperparameters to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.
